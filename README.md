## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`src/models.py`**: Data models for tracks, users, and recommendations
- **`src/recommendation_engine.py`**: Main AI recommendation engine
- **`data/sample_data.py`**: Sample tracks and user profiles for testing
- **`cli.py`**: Command-line interface

### Supported Features

#### Music Genres
- Rock, Pop, Jazz, Classical, Electronic, Hip Hop, Country, Blues, Reggae, Folk

#### Mood Preferences
- Energetic, Relaxed, Happy, Melancholic, Focused, Romantic

#### Context Types

## How It Works

1. **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes track features (genre, mood, energy, popularity) and user preferences
2. **Similarity Matching**: Uses cosine similarity to find tracks that match user taste
3. **Context Adjustment**: Modifies recommendations based on situational context
4. **Personalization**: Learns from user feedback and listening history

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python tests/test_recommendation_system.py
```

## API Usage

```python
from src.recommendation_engine import MusicRecommendationEngine
from src.models import UserProfile, RecommendationRequest, Genre, MoodPreference

# Initialize engine
engine = MusicRecommendationEngine()

# Create user profile
user_profile = UserProfile(
    user_id="john_doe",
    preferred_genres=[Genre.ROCK, Genre.POP],
    preferred_moods=[MoodPreference.ENERGETIC, MoodPreference.HAPPY],
    energy_preference=0.8
)

# Get recommendations
request = RecommendationRequest(
    user_profile=user_profile,
    num_recommendations=5,
    context="workout"
)

response = engine.get_recommendations(request)
```
